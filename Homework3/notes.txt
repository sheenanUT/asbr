PA3 Notes

FA = transform from optical tracker to calibration object 
NA = number of optical LED markers on calibration object
aj = position of LED marker j in FC
Aj = position of LED marker j relative to optic tracker
(Aj = FA * aj)

Freg = transform from EM coordinates to CT image coordinates
bj = position of body landmark j in CT image
Bj = position of body landmark j relative to EM tracker
NB = number of body landmarks
(bj = Freg * Bj)

FC = calibration object coordinate system (Does FA = FC?)
NC = number of EM markers on calibration object
ci = position of EM marker i in FC
Ci = position of EM marker i relative to EM tracker

FD = Transform from optical tracker to EM base
dj = position of EM base unit LED marker j relative to EM base unit
Dj = position of LED marker j relative to optic tracker
ND = number of LED markers on EM tracking base unit
(Dj = Fd * dj)

gi = position of EM marker i on EM probe relative to probe
Gi = position of probe EM marker i relative to EM tracker
NG = number of EM markers on EM probe

hi = position of LED marker i on optical probe relative to probe
Hi = position of probe LED marker i relative to optical tracker
NH = number of LED markers on optical probe

v = random noise in EM tracker data

Each sample frame of calibration data contains:
- Measurements A from 1 to NA
- Measurements C from 1 to NC
- Measurements D from 1 to ND

Each frame from optical probe data contains:
- Measurements D from 1 to ND
- Measurements H from 1 to NH

Each frame of EM probe data contains:
- Measurements G from 1 to NG

Calibration posts at unknown locations/orientations
Used for pivot calibration

Folder HW3-PA1 contains:
- 7 filled-out datasets for debugging (a-g)
- 4 unsolved datasets for grading (h-k)
